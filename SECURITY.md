# Security Policy

## ðŸ“¦ Supported Versions

Only the latest [release]() is supported.

## ðŸš¨ Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be sent in via [email]() to avoid publishing in the open.
This project does not have a bounty program, neither do we respond to bug bounties.

For valid security concerns, you can expect a response within 48 hours,
and credit is given once an acceptable fix is found and published.
