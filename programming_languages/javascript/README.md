# JavaScript Autodidacticism
 Brushing up what's forgotten...

```bash
- JavaScript is a web-based interpreted programming language.

- It runs in a web browser.

- It can be used to 
		--> add interactive behavior to webpages
		--> build mobile and web application
		--> create command line tools
		--> develop games

*Important Notes*

- JavaScript is not same as Java
- Knowing HTML & CSS is helpful when working with DOM (Document Object Model)
```
