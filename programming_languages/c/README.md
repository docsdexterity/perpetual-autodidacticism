# C Language

- C is a middle level language.
- It originated in 1970s.
- Most widely used programming language.
- It falls between the spectrum of low-level to high-level languages (i.e. in mid).
- Mother of all programming languages.
- C is not object-oriented.
- C++ is an extension of C.

## Low-level Languages
```
- Efficient
- They work closely with machine architecture.
- Consume less memory
- Fast
- Difficult to understand
- Time consuming to write
```
## High-level Languages
```
- Easier to work with.
- Easier to understand.
- Allow for more abstraction
- Slower
- Consume more memory
- Difficult to work with low level hardware
```
## Notes
```
- Mid-level languages act as a bridge between high-level softwares and applications
  as well as low-level hardware and embedded systems.
- Most compilers, kernels and operating systems are written in C.
- Nearly every language is influenced by C.
- Example: Python is written in C. Default implementation is CPython.
- C Language provided many of the original programming concepts such as
  variables, data types, loops, arrays, functions, etc.
- C is used everywhere. E.g. databases, cars, operating systems & embedded systems.
